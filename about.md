I'm a second-year Physics Ph.D. candidate at MIT studying gravitational-wave astrophysics with Salvatore Vitale. I'm exploring black hole populations and binary star evolution with current and next-generation gravitational-wave detectors.

I grew up in Oakland, CA and majored in Mathematics and Physics at Amherst College, where I graduated summa cum laude in 2023.
